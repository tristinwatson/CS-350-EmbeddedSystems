# CS-350-EmbeddedSystems
Uses Embedded C to control a TI Board

There are two separate projects in this repository. One project is a GPIO demonstration where the Red and Green LEDs spell out SOS or OK depending on the buttons pressed. The other project is a mock furnace that utilizes GPIO, I2C, UART, and Timers. GPIO programs the switches and LEDs, I2C programs the temperature reading system, UART communicates between the microcontroller and the computer, and the timer loops the three together. What I felt I did particularly well with during these projects was the
